### Systron-Donner Series 80

The [Systron-Donner Series 80](/reference/sd_80.pdf), first shipped in 1964, is the Cadillac of general-purpose analog computers.
It is transistor based instead of tube based as most of its contemporary analog computers, it offers a Â± 100V computing range providing 3-4 digit accuracy, and it offers a rich set of analog functions.
A Series 80 weighs about 700 pounds. It has a removable program panel; on the left is a picture of it with and without the program installed.

Our Series 80 is fully functional; the pictures show it executing (perhaps simulating a new Centaur processor function invention).
It is fully loaded with all of the optional features: 8 function generator cards, 220 10-turn potentiometers, digital voltmeter, and 42 computing modules.
The original price for this configuration in 1965 was over $60,000 (a price list is shown on the right).
Also shown is a picture from Boeing of a SD 80 in a Boeing 707 being used to analyze data for the SST program.
